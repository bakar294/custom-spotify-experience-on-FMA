**Spotify-like Experience App with Spark, MongoDB, FMA Dataset, and LSH**

This project builds a scalable music recommendation system inspired by Spotify, leveraging Apache Spark for distributed data processing, MongoDB for storing the massive FMA dataset (93 GB), and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient music similarity search.

**Project Overview**

* **Data Source:** Freesound Audio Tagging Dataset (FMA) ([invalid URL removed]) (93 GB)
* **Data Storage:** MongoDB
* **Data Processing:** Apache Spark
* **Similarity Search:** Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

**System Architecture**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Download the FMA dataset ([invalid URL removed]).
   - Preprocess audio features using tools like librosa ([https://librosa.org/](https://librosa.org/)).
   - Load preprocessed features into MongoDB for efficient storage.

2. **Spark Job:**
   - Read audio features from MongoDB using Spark's MongoDB connector.
   - Apply LSH for song embedding and similarity search.
   - Cache LSH tables for efficient retrieval.

3. **Recommendation Engine:**
   - Given a user's query (artist, song, genre, etc.), leverage LSH to retrieve similar songs.
   - Rank recommendations based on similarity scores and user preferences (optional).

**Key Features**

* **Scalability:** Spark's distributed processing handles large datasets efficiently.
* **Flexibility:** MongoDB's NoSQL nature accommodates various data structures.
* **Efficiency:** LSH speeds up similarity search for real-time recommendations.
* **Customization:** The system can adapt to user preferences and content types.

**Running the Application**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Apache Spark ([https://spark.apache.org/](https://spark.apache.org/)).
   - Install MongoDB ([https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)).
   - Set up a MongoDB cluster to accommodate the FMA dataset.
   - Ensure Spark has access to the MongoDB cluster.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Update `application.properties` with MongoDB connection details and LSH parameters.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess audio features using librosa or other tools.
   - Load preprocessed data into MongoDB.

4. **Building and Running:**
   - Run `mvn package` to build the project.
   - Run `spark-submit --class <main-class> target/spark-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to execute the Spark job. The `<main-class>` should point to the class containing your Spark application logic.

**Further Development**

* Integrate user preferences for personalized recommendations.
* Explore advanced similarity measures beyond LSH.
* Implement a user interface for recommendation display and interaction.

**Disclaimer**

This project serves as a foundation. Adapting it to production environments may require additional configuration, security measures, and optimization.

**Additional Notes**

* Consider using cloud-based solutions like Amazon EMR or Google Cloud Dataproc for managing Spark clusters.
* Profile and optimize your Spark job for performance on your specific hardware and dataset size.
* Implement robust error handling and logging for a production-ready system.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the strengths of both Response A and Response B, you can create a well-structured, informative, and user-friendly README that effectively guides users in setting up and running your Spotify-like experience application.
